Machine Learning prediction, Econometric modelization and Economic analysis applied to Cardiovascular diseases

Using quantitative methods to analyze health issues is very interesting. This work aims to determine, from a database on cardiovascular disease, the most important risk factors to consider in order to avoid the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. In addition, a more in-depth analysis is to be carried out to determine the best way to achieve cost-effective prevention of these diseases in the population.
